            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              The area of Cambridge shows evidence of settlement since the
              Bronze Age and later became a trading center in Roman and Viking
              times. By the 12th century, Cambridge had its first town charter,
              while the University of Cambridge was founded in 1209. The
              medieval colleges and their historic architecture remain central
              to the city’s identity and global reputation. In 1951, Cambridge
              was granted official city status, cementing its role as a cultural
              and academic hub shaped by centuries of scholarship.

              residents. The population is diverse, with a majority of White
              British residents alongside growing Asian and international
              communities. A high proportion of students and young professionals
              contribute to the city’s vibrant and highly educated demographic
              profile.

            <h2>Education & Economy</h2>
            <p>
              Cambridge is world-renowned as the home of the
              <em>University of Cambridge</em>, founded in 1209, with iconic
              sites like King’s College Chapel and the Cavendish Laboratory. The
              university and institutions such as Anglia Ruskin University drive
              the city’s academic, cultural, and economic life. Research output
              and entrepreneurial activity have made Cambridge a global hub for
              innovation, especially in technology and biotechnology, often
              called the “Silicon Fen.” The Cambridge Biomedical Campus and
              high-tech clusters provide significant employment with a workforce
              strongly concentrated in research and knowledge industries.

            <h2>Culture, Events & Transport</h2>
            <p>
              Cambridge has a rich cultural scene, with museums like the
              Fitzwilliam Museum, university collections, theaters, and
              festivals such as the Strawberry Fair. Sporting traditions,
              including the famous Boat Race, reflect the city’s strong
              university heritage. Modern music, art, and annual fairs
              contribute to a lively cultural calendar. Transport links include
              major roads (M11, A14), a busy railway station, and a
              well-connected bus network, while cycling is one of the most
              popular ways to move around. Visitors are also drawn to punting on
              the River Cam, historic college courtyards, and the city’s many
              green spaces.
