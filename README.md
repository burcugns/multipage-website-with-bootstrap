## Multi‑Page Website with Bootstrap

Migrated a static multi-page website about Cambridge to Bootstrap 4.5.2 for a modern, responsive design. The site includes Home, About, Explore, and Contact pages. Most old CSS was replaced with Bootstrap’s grid system, components, and utility classes, while some custom styles were retained for a unique look.

### Tech Stack

- **Bootstrap 4.5.2**
- **jQuery 3.5.1**
